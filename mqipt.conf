# File Name  : samples/mqiptSample.conf
#
# Project    : IBM MQ Internet Pass-Thru (MQIPT)
#
# Description: Sample configuration file for MQIPT. This file is used to  
#              define default properties for all routes and specific  
#              properties for each individual route.
#
#              Copy this file to mqipt.conf in the MQIPT home directory,
#              then make changes to the new file. MQIPT can only use a
#              configuration file of the name mqipt.conf. 
#
# Notes      : This sample configuration file shows some sample route 
#              definitions and how properties can be used.
#
#              See the IBM MQ Internet Pass-Thru documentation in the IBM MQ
#              Knowledge Center for a full explanation of each attribute and
#              sample configurations.
#
#              Change the properties to reflect your requirements, including
#              the installation directory.

# First route definition example (any platform) :
#
# This is a simple route which listens on port 1414 and connects to mqserver.company2.com
# on port address 1416. It expects to receive IBM MQ protocol data and does not use 
# HTTP or TLS (refer to global defaults) 
#
# Note:
# ListenerPort, Destination and DestinationPort can only be used in a route section.

#
# Second route definition example (Windows platform) :
#
# This route listens on port 1415 and connects to another MQIPT machine at 
# mqipt.company2.com on port address 1414 using TLS. The ListenerPort of the
# target MQIPT must be configured to accept TLS connections, i.e. SSLServer=true
# It expects to receive IBM MQ protocol data and will encrypt all data using
# the specified cipher suite.
#
# The sample key ring sslSample.pfx contains a certificate that can be used to
# test a connection. This TLS client will only accept certificates from a TLS
# server with an Organization name of IBM.
#
# SSLClientKeyRingPW contains the encrypted password for the sample key ring.
# The password is "mqiptSample".

#
# Third route definition example (Linux or UNIX platform) :
#
# This route listens on port 1416 for TLS data and connects to mqserver.company1.com 
# on port address 1415. The calling MQIPT must be configured to request a TLS connection,
# i.e. SSLClient=true.
#
# This TLS server will only accept certificates from a TLS client with an 
# Organization name of IBM and a name ending with Example Certificate.
# This route will not start when MQIPT is started, as Active=false.
#
# SSLServerKeyRingPW contains the encrypted password for the sample key ring.
# The password is "mqiptSample".

# Fourth route definition example (any platform) :
#
# This route listens on port 1417 and connects to mqipt.company1.com on port address 1415
# but does this via an HTTP proxy at proxy.company1.com on port address 8081. It expects 
# to receive IBM MQ protocol data and will wrap it in HTTP before sending it on.
